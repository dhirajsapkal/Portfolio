            <p>The project is administered during the spring 2016 and fall 2016 semesters focusing on design research addressing the changing nature of technology. In the spring 2016 semester, the team implemented the proposed pilot curriculum of a 6-credit  fth-year architecture studio (ARCH-508) and a parallel 3-credit special topics course (TXD-797-1/ DSGN-371) on 3D Textiles. The architecture studio incorporated components of physical computing; a textile design workshop; a design assignment of an interior sculptural installation; and a public art infrastructure/ renewable energy plant project (2016 Land Art Generator Initiative (LAGI) design competition), and exhibition of responsive prototypes at the Philadelphia Science Festival on April 30, 2016. The two courses were loosely coupled and joined around a one week workshop titled “Dilettante Textiles” that hosted a Dutch architect Luc Merx during the week of Feb. 14 and Feb. 20, 2016.</p>

          <p>During the workshop students were tasked to collaborate in cross-disciplinary teams of architecture, textile, industrial, and fashion design, to explore various textile techniques such as knitting, crocheting, weaving, and others, to design and produce three-dimensional textile structures. The 3D Textiles course students then continued to further develop 3D textile products that were exhibited at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair during May 14- 17, 2016, in the Javitz center in New York. The architecture studio introduced new skills in physical computing, textile techniques, and the design assignments allowed students to apply those technologies to a sustainable design problem, and tasked them to incorporate professional management issues such as cost estimating with guidance from the non- faculty architect practitioners. In the spring semester, the projects did not focus on textile applications for building envelopes but students were encouraged to  nd novel ways to apply textile applications on an interior sculptural installation assignment and the LAGI design competition.</p>

            <h2 class=" title-top">Non-faculty practitioner participation:</h2>
            <p class="">To enhance the learning experience in the architecture studio, the project team decided to increase the interaction with the non- faculty architect practitioners in the spring semester. In addition to the originally planned mid-term and  nal review participation, the practitioners were asked to introduce a one- week design assignment which was based on an actual project from their practice. The project was designed to speci cally emphasize constructability (cost estimating) and project management issues (strategies to manage client expectations) and to simulate a schematic design process in practice. For this project the practitioners participated in a desk crit and  nal review of this assignment.</p>

            <p>The Dutch architect Luc Merx who was invited for the textile workshop also participated in the review of this assignment. In connection with the LAGI design competition project, the practitioners gave a presentation on their professional approach to design competitions explaining what and why professionals would pursue speci c competitions, and subsequently participated in the 3⁄4 and  nal reviews of this project. This assignment o ered the students the opportunity to understand design thinking processes in practice; professional conduct (work ethics); and real world practice management issues.</p>

          <h2 class=" title-top">Interdisciplinary design studio and companion seminar curriculum:</h2>
          <p class="">The studio-seminar course coupling strategy has been implemented as planned. The spring semester companion 3D textiles seminar course o ered opportunities to extensively explore various textile techniques. The lessons learned from the course are used as the basis for the fall semester curriculum by the faculty for instructional purposes. While the one- week 3D Textiles joint workshop involved 15 architecture students from the studio and 24 industrial, textile, and fashion design students, for logistical reasons only four of the 15 architecture studio students formally enrolled in this course, limiting tighter integration between the two groups. Thus, in the spring semester the studio projects encouraged textile material applications but did not enforce the development of architectural textile composites for building envelopes. In the fall semester, all architecture studio students are required to co-enroll in a companion seminar course on experimental structures in architecture, and cross-disciplinary collaboration with textile and industrial design students will be facilitated through short modular assignments coordinated with the industrial and textile design project directors. This arrangement will let the architecture studio focus on textile design and research strategies for building envelopes with an emphasis on constructability, sustainability, and technology.</p>

This interaction will be expanded in the fall semester.</p>

          <P>If successful, the proposed interdisciplinary and companion studio/seminar curriculum can potentially be formalized to engage at a minimum 30  fth year architecture students per year. If the model is accepted at the architecture program level, additional studio sections could adopt a similar cross-disciplinary companion course structure with other topic focuses, broadening the impact of the project. The design research and student work supports the program directors’ research agenda in emerging technologies, materials and environmental issues, through prototyping and computation, and expanding disciplinary methods and practices. The  ndings of architectural textiles and composites for building envelopes ful ll the professions need for advancing the professions knowledge of material innovations and achieving high performance building systems.</P>
