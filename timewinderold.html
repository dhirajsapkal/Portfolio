	  			<p>Timewinder is a new way to look back at your past… Kinda like facebook’s memories…. but better… And it applies not just to facebook, but across to devices and across all your social media accounts ✌🏻</p>

	  			<p>Tell me the story. Start from the beginning.</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>It began when my designer was told to unbundle a feature from an existing app and turn it into a standalone app. For some reason he decided to pick the memories feature from facebook 😪<br>
					I bet siri doesn’t have these many limitations 😓</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<P>He started out by doing some market research and found an app called Timehop that already does this.</P>

	  				<div class="rich-right">
		  				<a href="www.timehop.com">www.timehop.com</a>
		  				<span>Timehop, an app that helps you see the best moments of your past!</span>
	  				</div>
	  			</div>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  		<P>However, timehop only covered social media, And not things that are stored on your phone 🤔</P>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>And this is weird because your phone is your most personal gadget ever. It is privy to some of the most private moments of life…. It probably knows more about you than your best friend 😜
					What if you could talk to your phone like it was your best friend, and re-live those moments you experience together 😁<br>And so, I was born 💁🏻</p>

	  			<ul class="points">
	  				<li><p>The interaction is entertaining, and people seemed to think that they would spend time just messing around with it.</p></li>

	  			<p>.<br>.<br>.<br>Any other questions? 😊</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="right-chat">
	  			<p>Yeah, Why a conversational UI… ?? 🤔</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>Well, a conversational UI brings a lot of advantages specifically for this use case:</p>
	  			<p style="margin-top: 20px"><b>It’s Intuitive :</b> It takes the user out of the user flow. You want to share an image? great, just say so and let me do the rest! You just be you 😎</p>
	  			<p style="margin-top: 20px"><b>It’s engaging :</b> I don’t need to sit around and wait for you to start the app. If i find something, I can just let you know with a short and sweet text message ☺️</p>
	  			<p style="margin-top: 20px"><b>It’s different :</b> This is a fun way to interact with your phone. Also, chat allows for rich media to be easily integrated with the UI in a manner that is familiar to the user. Instead, <b>I am the one who has to do the learning now!!</b> Nerd mode on! 🤓</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>As i get to know you better, I will learn to identify which memories you would find interesting, and which jokes make you go ROFLOLOLOL 😂</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>Anyway… Armed with this new knowledge, I got a makeover! 💇🏻</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="right-chat">
	  			<p>How did you validate this design??</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>Well, We went out and interviewed real users, Along with users from www.usertesting.com , All of whom were kind enough to give some helpful feedback.</p>
	  		</div>
	  		<div class="left-chat">
	  			<p>Here's what the folks from <a href="www.usertesting.com">User testing</a> had to say</p>
